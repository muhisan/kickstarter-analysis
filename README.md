# kickstarter-analysis

# Overview of Project:

The purpose of this project is to help Louise analyze her fundraising campaign for her play “Fever”. Now that we are nearing the end of the analysis, she wants us to complete the    analysis by analyzing the effectiveness of the different campaigns based on their launch date and funding objective.

# Analysis and Challenges:

Various analyses have already been done to help Louise get an idea and discover at a glance the trends and results of other campaigns based on different factors.
she knows already that:

  * the "Theater" Kickstarter campaigns have got the hightest success in United States.(figure1)

  * plays(subcategories) has achieved the greatest success among other subcategories in United States.(figure 2)

#### we need to provide two last analysis to Louise :
## 1. Outcomes Based on Launch Date
It is clear that May and June are the best months to launch the fundraising campaign and that December is the worst one.

## 2. Outcomes Based on Goals
Theatre/plays with a target of less than $20,000 have a high success rate.The lower the goal, the higher the percentage of success.
For instance, a campaign with a goal between $1000 and $5000, success is up to 70%.As a conclusion,Louise should probably try to get her play produced for less than what she planned to increase the chances of success.

# Results and suggestions

  * Given the results by launch date, it would be preferable for Louise to launch her fundraising campaign over the summer since May. Also, another suggestion for Louise would be to avoid launching her project from November to December. As we can see from the chart, December has the worst success rate.

  * Again, given the results by Goal, Louise should probably try to revise her goal amount because the chart shows that the majority of successful campaigns asked for less than what she is aiming for.

##### suggestions:
  * We could expand our analysis to use columns and sections of data that we did not include in this project for Louise, as the average amount of donations per backer for different campaign categories.

  * It will also be better to know the satisfaction rate of backers after having financed theatres/plays, for example. Thus, they could be potential supporters for Louise.
