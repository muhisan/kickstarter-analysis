# kickstarter-analysis

# Overview of Project:

The purpose of this project is to help Louise analyze her fundraising campaign for her play “Fever”. Now that we are nearing the end of the analysis, she wants us to complete the    analysis by analyzing the effectiveness of the different campaigns based on their launch date and funding objective.

# Analysis and Challenges:

Various analyses have already been done to help Louise get an idea and discover at a glance the trends and results of other campaigns based on different factors.
she knows already that:

*the "Theater" Kickstarter campaigns have got the hightest success in United States.(figure1)

*plays(subcategories) has achieved the greatest success among other subcategories in United States.(figure 2)

#### we need to provide two last analysis to Louise 
## 1. Outcomes Based on Launch Date
It is clear that May and June are the best months to launch the fundraising campaign and that December is the worst one.

## 2. Outcomes Based on Goals
Theatre/plays which goal is less than $20000 succeded.The lower the goal, the higher the percentage of success.
For instance, a campaign with a goal between $1000 and $5000, success is up to 70%.As a conclusion,Louise should probably try to get her play produced for less than what she planned to increase the chances of success.
e.i less than $10000
